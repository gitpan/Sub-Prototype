NAME
    Sub::Prototype - Set a subs prototype

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Prototype;

        BEGIN {
            my $code = sub { ... };
            set_prototype($code, '&@');
            *main::my_func = $code;
        }

        my_func { ... } @list;

FUNCTIONS
    This module only has one function, which is also exported by default:

  set_prototype(\&coderef, $prototype)
        set_prototype(\&some_function, '$$');

    Sets the prototype for "coderef" to $prototype.
